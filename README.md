# WhatchaWannaWatch

## Tutorial
Netflix doesn't display movies ratings, probably because some intern broke the code<br><br>
Despite the inconvenience caused by having to look up each movie's rating, this app offers to generate a list of current available Netflix movies and their IMDb ratings, ordered from the highest to lowest.<br><br>
`git clone` this repo on your machine and run `python3 getMoviesSorted.py [yourPreferredGenre]` to find out what you wanna watch tonight<br>
<br>
yourPreferredGenre options as of now:
- all
- action
- children
- classics
- comedies
- crime
- cult
- documentary
- dramas
- faith
- history
- horror
- ndependent
- international
- LGBTQ
- musicals
- romantic
- scifi
- nature
- sports
- standup
- thriller
